🎯 50 Days, 50 Projects Challenge for Beginners
👋 Hello everyone!
My name is Nouman Ahmed, and I'm currently learning web development. This repository is part of my 50 Days, 50 Projects Challenge designed specifically for beginners! 🚀

📝 About the Challenge
This challenge is inspired by similar projects from other developers on GitHub. My goal is to complete 50 small projects in 50 days to sharpen my skills. These projects focus on project-based learning—one of the best ways for beginners to practice and solidify their knowledge. 💪

💡 Why Project-Based Learning?
For beginners, it's essential to not only watch tutorials but also build real projects. This approach helps you:

👨‍💻 Apply what you learn in real scenarios.
🛠️ Understand concepts better through hands-on practice.
⏳ Learn more efficiently in a shorter time.
📅 The Plan
Every day, I will create and share a new project focusing on different aspects of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each project is designed to be simple yet effective for learning.
